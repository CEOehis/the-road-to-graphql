## FAQ

**How to get updates?** I have two channels where I share updates about my content. Either you can [subscribe to updates by email](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch). Regardless of the channel, my objective is to only share qualitative content. You will never receive any spam. Once you get the update that the book has changed, you can download the new version of it.

**How to get access to the source code projects and screencasts series?** If you have bought one of the extended packages that gives you access to the source code projects, screencast series or any other addon, you should find these on your [course dashboard](https://roadtoreact.com/my-courses). If you have bought the course somewhere else than on [the official Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com) course platform, you need to create an account on the platform, go to the Admin page and reach out to me with one of the email templates. Afterward I can enroll you to the course. If you haven't bought one of the extended packages, you can reach out any time to upgrade your content to access the source code projects and screencast series.

**How can I get help while reading the book?** The book has a [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) for people who are reading the book. You can join the channel to get help or to help others. After all, helping others can internalize your learnings, too. If there is no one out to help you, you can always reach out to me.

**Is there any troubleshoot area?** If you run into problems, please join the Slack Group. In addition, you could have a look into the [open issues on GitHub](http://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-graphql/issues) for the book. Perhaps your problem was already mentioned and you can find the solution for it. If your problem wasn't mentioned, don't hesitate to open a new issue where you can explain your problem, maybe provide a screenshot, and some more details (e.g. book page, node version). After all, I try to ship all fixes in next editions of the book.

**What should I do when I cannot afford to pay for the course?** If you cannot afford the course but want to learn about the topic, you can reach out to me. It could be that you are still a student or that the course would be too expensive in your country. In addition, I want to support any cause to improve the diversity in our culture of developers. If you belong to a minority or are in an organization that supports diversity, please reach out to me.

**Can I help to improve the content?** Yes, I would love to hear your feedback. You can simply open an issue on [GitHub](http://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-graphql). These can be improvements technical wise yet also about the written word. I am no native speaker that's why any help is appreciated. You can open pull requests on the GitHub page as well.

**How to support the project?** If you believe in the content that I create, you can [support me](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/). Furthermore, I would be grateful if you spread the word about this book after you read it and enjoyed reading it. Furthermore, I would love to have you as my [Patron on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rwieruch).

**Is there a money back guarantee?** Yes, there is 100% money back guarantee for two months if you don't think it's a good fit. Please reach out to me to get a refund.

**Why does it use React to teach about GraphQL?** GraphQL is often used in modern applications to connect your client and server applications. These applications are often built with solutions such as React, Angular and Vue. In order to teach about GraphQL, it makes sense to apply it in a real world context such as React for your client application. I picked React, because it has only a slim API and a good learning curve. It is only the view layer in your tech stack. You can learn about it in [the Road to learn React](https://roadtoreact.com). However, you can apply your learnings about GraphQL in other client-side applications too.

**Why does it use Node/Express to teach about GraphQL?** You can not only consume third-party GraphQL APIs with your client application, but also implement your own GraphQL API on the server-side. Since it is more efficient to stick to one programming language (JavaScript), I picked Node.js for it. Furthermore, Express.js is the most popular choice when having a Node.js application. That's why I picked it over alternatives such as Hapi or Koa.

**What's your motivation behind the book?** I want to teach about this topic in a consistent way. You often find material online that doesn't receive any updates or only teaches a small part of a topic. When you learn something new, people struggle to find consistent and up-to-date resources to learn from. I want to give you this consistent and up-to-date learning experience. In addition, I hope I can support minorities with my projects by giving them the content for free or by [having other impacts](https://www.robinwieruch.de/giving-back-by-learning-react/). In addition, in the recent time, I found myself fulfilled when teaching others about programming. It's a meaningful activity for me that I prefer over any other 9 to 5 job at any company. That's why I hope to pursue this path in the future.

**Is there a call to action?** Yes. I want you to take a moment to think about a person who would be a good match to learn GraphQL. The person could have shown the interest already, could be in the middle of learning GraphQL or might not yet be aware about wanting to learn GraphQL. Reach out to that person and share the book. It would mean a lot to me. The book is intended to be given to others.
