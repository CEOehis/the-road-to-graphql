## FAQ

**Why does it use React to teach about GraphQL?** GraphQL is often used in modern applications to connect your client and server applications. These applications are often built with solutions such as React, Angular and Vue. In order to teach about GraphQL, it makes sense to apply it in a real world context such as React for your client application. I picked React, because it has only a slim API and a good learning curve. It is only the view layer in your tech stack. You can learn about it in [the Road to learn React](https://roadtoreact.com). However, you can apply your learnings about GraphQL in other client-side applications too.

**Why does it use Node/Express to teach about GraphQL?** You can not only consume third-party GraphQL APIs with your client application, but also implement your own GraphQL API on the server-side. Since it is more efficient to stick to one programming language (JavaScript), I picked Node.js for it. Furthermore, Express.js is the most popular choice when having a Node.js application. That's why I picked it over alternatives such as Hapi or Koa.

**How to get updates?** I have two channels where I share updates about my content. You can [subscribe to updates by email](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch). Regardless of the channel, my objective is to only share quality content. Once you receive notification the book has changed, you can download a new version of it.

**How to get access to the source code projects and screencasts series?** If you bought one of the extended packages that grant access to the source code projects, screencast series or any other add-on, you should find these on your [course dashboard](https://roadtoreact.com/my-courses). If you bought the course other than [the official Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com) course platform, create an account on the platform, and then go to the Admin page and contact me with one of the email templates. After that I can enroll you in the course. If you haven't bought one of the extended packages, you can reach out any time to upgrade your content to access the source code projects and screencast series.

**How can I get help while reading the book?** The book has a [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) for people who are reading along. You can join the channel to get help, or to help others, as helping others may help you internalize your own understanding. If there is no one available to help you, you can always reach out to me.

**Is there any troubleshoot area?** If you run into problems, please join the Slack Group. Also, check the [open issues on GitHub](http://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-graphql/issues) to see if any solutions are listed for specific issue. If your problem wasn't mentioned, open a new issue where you can explain your problem, provide a screenshot, and offer more details (e.g. book page, node version).

**What should I do when I cannot afford to pay for the course?** If you cannot afford the course but want to learn about the topic, you can reach out to me. It could be that you are still a student or that the course would be too expensive in your country. In addition, I want to support any cause to improve the diversity in our culture of developers. If you belong to a minority or are in an organization that supports diversity, please reach out to me.

**Can I help to improve the content?** Yes, I love to hear feedback. Simply open an issue on [GitHub](http://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-graphql). These can be technical improvements, or clarification on the discussed topics. I am not a native speaker, so any feedback is appreciated. You can open pull requests on the GitHub page as well.

**Is there a money back guarantee?** Yes, there is 100% money back guarantee for two months if you don't think it's a good fit. Please reach out to me to get a refund.

**How to support the project?** If you believe in the content I create, you can [support me](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/). It also helps if you spread the word about this book, or you can sign on as my [Patron on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rwieruch).

**What's your motivation behind the book?** I want to teach about this topic consistently. I often find materials online that don't receive update, or only applies to a small part of a topic. Sometimes people struggle to find consistent and up-to-date resources to learn from. I want to provide this consistent and up-to-date learning experience. Also, I hope I can support the less fortunate with my projects by giving them the content for free or by [having other impacts](https://www.robinwieruch.de/giving-back-by-learning-react/). Recently I'v found myself fulfilled when teaching others about programming, as it's a meaningful activity I prefer over any 9 to 5 job at any company. I hope to continue this path in the future.

**Is there a call to action?** Yes. I want you to take a moment to think about a person who would be a good match to learn React. The person could have shown the interest already, could be in the middle of learning React or might not yet be aware about wanting to learn React. Reach out to that person and share the book. It would mean a lot to me. The book is intended to be given to others.
