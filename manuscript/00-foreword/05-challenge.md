# Challenge

Personally I write a lot about my learnings. That's how I got where I am right now. You are teaching a topic at its best when you have just learned about it yourself. Since teaching helped me a lot in my career, I want you to experience the same effects of it. But first you have to do the cause: teaching yourself. My challenge for the book is the following: teach others what you are learning while reading the book. A couple of breakpoints on how you could achieve it:

* Write a blog post about a specific topic from the book. It's not about copying and pasting the material but rather about teaching the topic your own way. Find your own words to explain something, grab a problem and solve it, and dive even more into the topic by understanding every detail about it. Then teach it to others in this one article. You will see how it fills your knowledge gaps, because you have to dig deeper into the topic, and how it opens doors for your career in the long term.

* If you are active on social media, grab a couple of things you have learned while reading the book and share them with your friends. For instance, you can tweet a hot tip on Twitter about your last learning from the book which may be interesting for others too. Just take a screenshot of the passage of the book or even better: write about it in your own words. That's how you can get into teaching without investing much time.

* If you feel confident recording your learning adventure, share your way through the book on Facebook Live, YouTube Live or Twitch. It helps you to stay concentrated and work your way through the book. Even though you don't have many people following your live session, you can always use the video to put it on YouTube afterward. Besides it is a great way to verbalize your problems and how you are going to solve them.

I would love to see people doing especially the last breakpoint: record yourself while reading this book, implementing the application(s), and conducting the exercises, and put the final version on YouTube. If parts in between of the recording are taking longer, just cut the video or use a timelapse effect for them. If you get stuck and need to fix a bug, don't leave it out but rather include these passages in the video, because they are so valuable for your audience which may run into the same issues. I believe it is important to have these parts in your video. A couple of tipps for the video:

* Do it in your native language or in English if you feel comfortable with it.

* Verbalize your thoughts, the things you are doing or the problems you are running into. Having a visual video is only one part of the challenge, but the other part is you narrating through the implementation. It doesn't have to be perfect. Instead it should feel natural and not polished as all the other video courses online where nobody runs into problems.

* If you run into bugs, embrace the trouble. Try to fix the problem yourself and search online for help, don't give up, and speak about the problem and how you attempt to solve it. This helps others to follow your thought process. As I said before, it has no value to follow polished video courses online where the instructor never runs into problems. It's the most valuable part to see someone else fixing a bug in the source code.

* Some words about the technical side of the recording: Check your audio before you record a longer video. It should have the correct volume and the quality should be alright too. Regarding your editor/IDE/terminal, make sure to increase the font size. Maybe it is possible to place the code and the browser side by side. If not, make them fullscreen and switch between (e.g. MacOS CMD + Tab).

* Edit the video yourself before you put it on YouTube. It doesn't have to be a high quality, but you should try to keep it concise for your audience (e.g. leaving out the reading passages and rather summarize the steps in your own words).

In the end, you can reach out to me for promoting anything you have released. For instance, if the video turns out well, I would love to include it in this book as officially supplementary material. Just reach out to me once you finished it. After all, I hope you accept this challenge to enhance your learning experience while reading the book which also may help others. I wish you all the best for it.
