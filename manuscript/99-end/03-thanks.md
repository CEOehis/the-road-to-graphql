## Thank You

Foremost, I want to thank you for reading this book or taking the full course. My greatest wish is that you had a great learning experience with the material. I hope you feel empowered now to build your own applications that use state management. I strive to go in the direction of education, so I depend on your feedback, both positive and critical.

Visit [my website](https://www.robinwieruch.de/) to find more topics about software and web development, and I have updates are available by [subscription](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch). The updates will be in-depth content, but never spam. See the [Learning Paths](learning-paths.md link) chapter for more resources.

If you liked the learning experience, I hope you share it with others.  Think about people in your life who want to learn more about this topic, regardless of using React, React Native, Angular or Vue. I believe developers need to align on this topic to reach the next level with modern applications.

Thanks for reading,
Robin.
