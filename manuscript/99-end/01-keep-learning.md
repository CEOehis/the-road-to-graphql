## Never stop Learning

I believe there is one secret when it comes to learning. There exists a principle that is called the Learning Pyramid. When you search for it in your favorite search engine, you will definitely find it. Basically, it shows the relation between retention rates and mental activities. For instance, the average student retention when doing lectures is 5%. That's not a good rate at all. Let's see how all the other mental activities break down according to their retention rates:

* **5% Lecture**
* **10% Reading** (Uuups!)
* **20% Audiovisual** (Phewww, it's difficult to transform a coding book into an audiobook. Who wants to the read the code out loud?)
* **30% Demonstration** (Check!)
* **50% Discussion** (Did I mention that there is a [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/)?)
* **75% Practice by Doing** (That's what the last chapter was all about!)
* **90% Teach Others** (Help other people in Slack Communities, Open Source or on platforms such as Facebook Groups and Reddit.)

Perhaps you recall it from somewhere, but it is always refreshing to see it again. In the beginning of the book, I told you that nobody became perfect by reading a book. You have to apply your learnings. I hope that I arranged the book in a way, enabling you with all the skills along the way, that you can learn form these experiences. In addition, I gave you some more learning paths to practice by doing in the last chapter.

Finally, let's get to the one secret about learning that I mentioned. It is the bottom item in the pyramid that has the biggest return of investment: Teaching Others. Personally, I made the same experience when I started to write about web development on my website, answered questions on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Robin-Wieruch), Reddit and Stack Overflow, and wrote a book(s). You have to dive deep into a topic in order to teach it to others. You learn about the little nuances and you dive deep into these topics because you want to teach them the right way. It's no shallow learning experience, because you get to know every detail in order to explain it precisely. You will learn plenty of stuff that you didn't know before. And most importantly, you will internalize these things by teaching it to others.

After all, you can't know everything. No one is an expert in everything. I challenge myself too, by trying to teach others about these technologies. I get great feedback from people, positive and negative, that I can apply to grow myself. You can do it as well. You can become better by challenging yourself, teach something to others and grow yourself.

So here is my quest for you after you read this book. I am sure that you have a friend, co-worker or perhaps someone you know only online, from Stack Overflow or Reddit, who is keen to learn about the things from this book. Schedule a get-together with this person and teach this person everything you have learned. You can take this book as guidance. After all, teaching others is a win-win situation. Both participants, mentor and student, will grow from it. So my advice for you: Become a mentor and teach others to improve yourself as a human being but also developer.
