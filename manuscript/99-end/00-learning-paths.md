# Last but not Least

Well, if I haven't lost you by now, you can read a bit further to make it to the end of this book. The last short chapters of this book have the objective to inspire you to apply your learnings. So far, the book has taught you how to use GraphQL in JavaScript on the client- and server-side. You have used React on the client-side and Express on the server-side. On both ends you got to use Apollo eventually to have a sophisticated GraphQL library between both entities. However, there is plenty of room to explore the ecosystem. If you haven't done all exercise from the book or read all the referenced articles, you should start with these. Otherwise, let's see what else you can do to advance your GraphQL skills.

## Further Learning Paths

You have built a couple of applications in this book. While reading the chapters, you adapted the applications to apply advanced techniques (e.g. permission-based authorization), tools (e.g. GraphQL Playground) or features (e.g. GitHub commenting). Perhaps you even followed all of the exercises closely in the book. But that's not the end. It's the end of me guiding you through this journey, but now it's up to you to continue with it. I guess there are far more features, techniques or tools that you could apply to these applications. Be creative and challenge yourself by implementing these on your own. I am curious what you come up with, so don't hesitate to reach out to me.

The book has used React on the client-side and Express on the server-side. However, as GraphQL and also the Apollo libraries are framework agnostic, you can couple them with any other solution. If you are familiar with Angular or Vue, you can transfer your learnings for GraphQL and Apollo over there for building client-side applications with these frameworks. If you are more into Koa or Hapi on the server-side, you can use these middleware libraries instead of Express as you have done in the book. The same applies for the database used for the GraphQL server application. In this book, you have used PostgreSQL with the Sequelize ORM to connect your GraphQL resolvers to the PostgreSQL database. It's up to you to substitute PostgreSQL and Sequelize with something else like MongoDB and Mongoose. Also the Apollo client and server libraries can be substituted with other libraries from the ecosystem. You read about them in the introduction chapters of this book. What about using [Yoga GraphQL](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to get your GraphQL server up and running? After all, all technologies used in this book are not set in stone. You can substitute every technology (e.g. React, Express, PostgreSQL, Apollo) to build GraphQL applications with JavaScript.

All GraphQL libraries used in this book are open source. That's why it is possible for you to contribute to the projects. It can be intimidating to contribute in open source, but it is a great return of investment. Just start by helping out for the documentation or by answering questions in GitHub issues. You will immediately find yourself in a great community of contributors. You can even go beyond it and try to solve bug issues, review pull requests or help out people on other platforms such as Reddit or Facebook Groups. By contributing to the topic itself, giving back something to the community, you will grow your learnings in the topic.

Yet another learning path could be to build your own GraphQL library from scratch to contribute to the GraphQL ecosystem. It's not too difficult to get started, for instance with a simple GraphQL client library. I take you on a step by step journey in this tutorial: [How to build a GraphQL client library for React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-graphql-client-library/). You can continue afterward by implementing caching, normalization or a global store with a state management library such as Redux or MobX yourself. If you had not the chance to dive into one of these state management libraries, checkout my other book: Taming the State in React. Anyways, by building a GraphQL library yourself, you will fortify your learnings.

The ultimate recommendation would be to continue with the Apollo Server application that you have built in this book. It's the perfect starter kit to realize your own ideas. As mentioned before, you are free to substitute the techniolgies used under the hood, but it would be great to just focus on the features for your application, wouldn't it? Since all the user management is implemented for you, you can start to add your own features to the application. Be creative and be driven by your creativity. As you can see, there are endless possibilities to apply your learnings. Don't hesitate and jump into coding. I am curious what you come up with, so please reach out to me.
